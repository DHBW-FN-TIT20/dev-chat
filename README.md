# Welcome to DEV-CHAT!
Hello World! This is [DEV-CHAT](https://dev-chat.me), a webchat for all the developers out there. In simple throw-away chatrooms you can talk to others, without leaving your comfort zone of the command-line. It is a current project of six second-year students at the  university [DHBW Friedrichshafen](https://www.ravensburg.dhbw.de/startseite) located in the south of germany and was created as a part of an exam.

## Instructions

To chat with others simply visit the website of [DEV-CHAT](dev-chat.me), create an account and login. On the main page enter the three word room name, given to you by other users or create one on your own. The name will be created automatically and you will instantly enter the room. Now you only have to share the room name and wait for the other developers to join.
